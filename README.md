## Intro
> In this section, we will take a look at one such feature extraction technique, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients" title="Link to notebook" style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none">The Histogram of oriented Gradients </a>, which transforms image pixels into a vector representation that is sensitive to broadly informative image features regardless of confounding factors like illumination. We will use these features to develop a simple vehicle detection pipeline, using machine learning algorithms .

## Reading all Vehicale images and converting them to Grayscale
> GTI_Far : contains all the zoomed version of vehicles that are far.

> GTI_Left : contains all the left and zoomed version of vehicles that are far.

> GTI_Right : contains all the right and zoomed version of vehicles that are far.

> GTI_MiddleClose : contains all the middle and zoomed version of vehicles that are far.

> KITTI_extracted : contains images extracted from publically available kitty dataset , these images contains distinguished orientations.

## :wink: Thanks
